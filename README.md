LSTM Encoder-Decoder for Video Caption Generation

Developed a Python-based LSTM encoder-decoder framework to automate video caption generation. Utilized the MSVD dataset with 120k sentences and achieved a BLEU score of 0.610, indicating significant similarity between machine-generated captions and high-quality reference translations. This project enhances the capability of automated video understanding and description using deep learning techniques.
