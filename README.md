LSTM Encoder-Decoder for Video Caption Generation

A Python-based LSTM encoder-decoder framework to automate video caption generation. Utilized the MSVD dataset with 120k sentences and achieved a BLEU score of 0.610, indicating significant similarity between machine-generated captions and high-quality reference translations. This project enhances automated video understanding and description capability using deep learning techniques.
